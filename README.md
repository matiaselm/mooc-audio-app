# MOOC audio-app

 - [the backend](https://github.com/matiaselm/mooc-audio-api)

## Current features

### Play audio from a selected source, [muutoslehti](https://www.muutoslehti.fi/podcastit/) I apologise for not having any english audio, the app is designed to use specifically these.

### Voice input controlling the audio, recognized commands:
 - hi / hello
 - help / don't know
 - stop / pause / wait / hold up
 - what / about / current
 - play / resume
 - list / episodes
 - change / change to number  - isn't interactable yet
 - next
 - previous

### take notes and save them with current audio and timestamp. Return to that part with a press of a button

### change language between finnish and english, change users name

### No authentication / need to login. Users' are added to database the second they open the app, it doesn't store anything personal.
