# MOOC audio-app

Application for school design course. Planned features:
 - Play audio from different back-end sources using apps' controls
 - Voice recognition for controlling audio
 - Audio to text for taking notes
 
 ## TODO
 - Build the UI according to design plans
 
## Current status
 - The app is basically empty. On home-screen it has one button and a bottom navigation. None have any functionality.

## How to install
 - Make sure you have Node.js/npm and expo-cli installed to your machine
 - Clone this repo to somewhere on your pc
 - From project root, type 'npm install' to command line
 - After that, type 'npm start' to command line
 - If everything works correcly, expo interface should open up to a browser window
    - If you have android/iOS emulator, start it up. I recommend installing an android emulator from android studio
    - If you want to run the app on your physical device, install expo go from the application store and scan the QR code shown on the site OR use usb-cable and connect it to your pc having USB-debugging turned on
 - Now you should have the development build open on your device. You can see the changes live on the device whenever you save
